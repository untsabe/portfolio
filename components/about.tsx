            I'm a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that blend thoughtful
            design with robust engineering. My favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
            creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.

             I am a passionate and driven software developer with experience building applications across diverse 
             environmentsâ€”from academic projects and startups to personal ventures. 
             My journey has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, adaptability, 
             and a keen eye for creating impactful digital solutions. Beyond development, 
             I enjoy sharing knowledge and continuously exploring modern technologies to deliver innovative,
              user-centered products.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my spare time, I'm usually reading, hiking, hanging out with friends and family, or working on side
            projects.
