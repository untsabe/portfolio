          I am a highly motivated final-year Computer Science student, having successfully completed all theoretical modules for my diploma. I am now actively seeking a Work Integrated Learning (WIL)
           opportunity to apply my strong academic foundation in a practical, professional setting.
          I'm a full-stack developer specializing in building (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital
          experiences. Currently, I'm focused on building accessible, human-centered products.
